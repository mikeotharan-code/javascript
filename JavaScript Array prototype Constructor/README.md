The prototype constructor allows you to add new properties and methods to the Array() object.

When construting a property, ALL arrays will be given the property, and its value, as default.

When constructing a method, ALL arrays will have this method availabe.

Note: Array prototype does not refer to a single array, but to the Array() object itself.

Note: Prototype is a global object constructor which is available for all JavaScript objects.
